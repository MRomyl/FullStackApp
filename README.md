# StudyBuddy

StudyBuddy is a full-stack web application that helps users track courses and log study sessions in a clean, distraction-free interface. Users can create an account, manage their own courses, and record how much time they spend studying — all securely and persistently.

This project was built as a capstone full-stack application using React and Flask with authentication and authorization.
